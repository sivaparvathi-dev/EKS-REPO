6 ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING:
  TRADE CAPITAL EXPENSE FOR VARIABLE EXPENSE: you can pay only when you consume computing resources and pay for hoe much you consume.
  BENIFIT FROM MASSIVE ECONOMIES OF A SCALE: it achieves ECONOMIES OF SCALE which translate into LOWER PAY AS YOU GO
  STOP GUESSING CAPACITY: bu using scale up/down as required 
  INCREASE SPEED AND AGILITY: in cloud computing ,new IT resources are only a click away,which means you can reduce the time to make those available to develeopers from weeks to minutes.
  STOP SPENDING MONEY RUNNING AND MAIANTAINING DATA CENTERS:focus on projects that diffirenciate your businness but not on the infrastructure.
  GO GLOBAL IN MINUTES: Easily deploy appliaction in multiple regions worldwide with FEW CLICKS.lower latency,better experience for custmers with minimal cost.
